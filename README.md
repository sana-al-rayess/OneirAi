Here's a brief high-level overview of the tech stack OneirAi app uses:
- This project uses the [Laravel framework](https://laravel.com/). Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax.
- As database, MySQL was used.
- OneirAi uses the [React](https://reactjs.org/) library for the front-end. React makes it painless to create interactive UIs, is component-based and is reusable.
